They allow functions to be dynamic and reusable.\n","\n","1. Parameters vs Arguments\n","Parameters: Variables listed in a function definition.\n","Arguments: Values passed to a function when calling it.\n","\n","Types of Function Arguments in Python\n","Python supports four types of function arguments:\n","\n","1. Positional Arguments\n","The arguments are assigned to parameters based on their position.\n","The order in which you pass arguments matters\n","\n","2. Default Arguments\n","You can assign default values to parameters.\n","If an argument is not provided, the default value is used.\n","\n","3.

What is the purpose of the return statement in a Python function?\n","\n","ans- Purpose of the return Statement in a Python Function\n","The return statement in Python is used to exit a function and send back a value to the caller. It determines what a function outputs after execution.\n","\n","1. Returning a Value\n","A function can return a computed result using return.\n","\n","2.

Using return in Loops\n","A function can return a value inside a loop.\n","\n","**question5.**What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n","\n","ans- Iterators vs. Iterables in Python\n","In Python, iterators and iterables are used for looping over data efficiently, but they have key differences.\n","\n","1. What is an Iterable?\n","An iterable is an object that can return an iterator. It contains data that can be looped over, such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, and strings.\n","\n","2. What is an Iterator?\n","An iterator is an object that produces values one at a time when iterated over. It remembers its current position and does not store all values in memory at once.\n","\n","Key Characteristics of an Iterator:\n","It implements _iter_() (returns itself).\n","It implements _next_() (returns the next item).\n","It raises a StopIteration error when there are no more items.\n","\n","3. Key Differences Between Iterables and Iterators\n","Feature\tIterable\tIterator\n","Definition\tAn object that can return an iterator\tAn object that produces values one at a time\n","Methods\tImplements _iter()\tImplements __iter() and __next_()\n","Examples\tLists, tuples, dictionaries, strings\tObjects returned by iter()\n","Memory Usage\tStores all elements in memory\tGenerates elements one by one\n","Reusability\tCan be reused (e.g., loop multiple times)\tCannot be reused once exhausted\n","Manual Access\tCannot use next() directly\tUses next() to get the next value.\n","\n","4. Converting an Iterable into an Iterator\n","The iter() function can be used to convert an iterable into an iterator.\n","\n","5. Creating a Custom Iterator (Using a Class)\n","You can create your own iterator by defining a class with _iter() and __next_() methods.\n","\n","**question6**. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n","\n","ans- Generators in Python\n","\n","1. A generator in Python is a special type of iterator that generates values lazily, meaning it produces values one at a time only when requested, instead of storing them in memory like lists.\n","\n","Generators use the yield keyword instead of return, allowing them to pause execution and resume from where they left off.\n","\n","2. A generator is defined like a normal function but uses yield instead of return.\n","\n","3. Using Generators in Loops (for loop)\n","Generators can be used directly in loops without calling next().\n","\n","5. Generator Expression (Shorter Syntax)\n","Like list comprehensions, generator expressions create generators in a compact way.\n","\n","**question7**  What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n","\n","ans- Advantages of Using Generators Over Regular Functions in Python\n","Generators offer several benefits over regular functions, especially when dealing with large datasets, streaming data, or memory-intensive operations.\n","\n","1. Memory Efficiency (Lazy Evaluation)\n","Generators do not store all values in memory. They produce values one by one only when needed, making them more memory-efficient.\n","Regular functions return entire lists or objects, which consume more memory.\n","\n","2. Faster Execution (No Need to Wait for Entire List)\n","A generator starts producing values immediately, whereas a regular function must compute all values before returning\n","\n","3. Infinite Sequences (Can Generate Unlimited Values)\n","Generators can run indefinitely without storing all values.\n","Regular functions must return a finite list, which is not always practical\n","\n","4. Simplified Code (Cleaner & More Readable)\n","Generators remove the need for managing lists, loops, and temporary variables, leading to cleaner code.\n","\n","5. On-Demand Execution (Better Performance)\n","Generators only compute the next value when needed, saving processing power.\n","Regular functions compute everything before returning, which may be unnecessary if not all values are used.\n","\n","**question8** What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n","\n","ans- A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous (unnamed) function that can have any number of arguments but only one expression. It is defined using the lambda keyword instead of def.\n","\n","Syntax:\n","lambda arguments: expression\n","The expression is evaluated and returned.\n","It does not use the return keyword explicitly.\n","\n","Lambda functions are typically used for short, simple operations where defining a full function using def is unnecessary.\n","\n"," 1. Inside map(), filter(), and reduce()\n","Lambda functions are commonly used in functional programming.\n","\n","  numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n","  squared = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers))\n","  print(squared)\n","# Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n","\n","2. In Sorting (sorted() with key)\n","Lambda functions are useful for sorting custom criteria.\n","\n","    pairs = [(1, 3), (2, 2), (4, 1)]\n","    sorted_pairs = sorted(pairs, key=lambda x: x[1])\n","    print(sorted_pairs)\n"," # Output: [(4, 1), (2, 2), (1, 3)]\n","\n"," 3. In lambda with if-else (Ternary Operations)\n","You can use conditional logic inside lambda functions.\n","\n","Example: Check Even or Odd\n","\n","  even_or_odd = lambda x: \"Even\" if x % 2 == 0 else \"Odd\"\n","    print(even_or_odd(10))  \n","# Output: Even\n","print(even_or_odd(7))\n","# Output: Odd\n","\n","4. Inside functions – Passing Functions as Arguments\n","Lambda functions are useful when passing simple functions as arguments.\n","\n","Example: Higher-Order Function\n","\n","def apply_function(func, value):\n","    return func(value)\n","\n","result = apply_function(lambda x: x ** 3, 3)\n","print(result)\n","# Output: 27\n","\n","**question9**  Explain the purpose and usage of the map() function in Python.\n","\n","ans- The map() function in Python applies a given function to all items in an iterable (e.g., list, tuple) and returns a map object (iterator) containing the results.\n","\n","Example 1: Squaring Numbers\n","numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n","squared = map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers)\n","print(list(squared))  \n","# Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n","\n","* Using map() with a Predefined Function\n","Instead of using a lambda function, we can use a regular function.\n","\n","Example 2: Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit\n","def celsius_to_fahrenheit(c):\n","    return (c * 9/5) + 32\n","\n","celsius_temps = [0, 10, 20, 30, 40]\n","fahrenheit_temps = map(celsius_to_fahrenheit, celsius_temps)\n","print(list(fahrenheit_temps))\n"," # Output: [32.0, 50.0, 68.0, 86.0, 104.0]\n","\n","* Using map() with Multiple Iterables\n","You can pass multiple iterables if the function takes multiple arguments.\n","\n","Example 3: Adding Two Lists Element-wise\n","list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n","list2 = [5, 6, 7, 8]\n","\n","sum_list = map(lambda x, y: x + y, list1, list2)\n","print(list(sum_list))\n"," # Output: [6, 8, 10, 12]\n","\n","* Using map() with str Methods\n","map() can be used with string functions as well.\n","\n","Example 4: Convert Strings to Uppercase\n","names = [\"alice\", \"bob\", \"charlie\"]\n","uppercase_names = map(str.upper, names)\n","print(list(uppercase_names))\n"," # Output: ['ALICE', 'BOB', 'CHARLIE']\n","\n"," **question 10** What is the difference between map(), reduce(), and filter() functions in Python?\n","\n","ans- Difference Between map(), reduce(), and filter() in Python\n","Python provides three functional programming functions: map(), filter(), and reduce(). All three take a function and an iterable as inputs, but they serve different purposes.\n","\n","1. map() – Apply a Function to Each Element\n","The map() function applies a function to each element in an iterable and returns an iterator with the transformed values.\n","\n","2. filter() – Select Elements Based on a Condition\n","The filter() function filters elements based on a condition (returns only elements for which the function evaluates to True).\n","\n","3. reduce() – Reduce an Iterable to a Single Value\n","The reduce() function applies a function cumulatively to the elements of an iterable, reducing it to a single value.\n","\n","**question 11** Using pen & Paper write the internal mechanism for sum operation using  reduce function on this given list:[47,11,42,13];\n","\n","ans-"],"metadata":{"id":"mUdxowPgC-fx"}}]}
